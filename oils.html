												A potent purifying essential oil with a refreshing lemony, herbal aroma! Lemongrass oil contains
												high quantities of geranial and neral—together known as “citral.” Citral makes lemongrass a powerful
												choice for cleaning the whole house. Use it for areas where germs and fungi like to gather, such as
												the shower stall. While lemongrass’s aroma is calming, citral can irritate the skin, so dilute this
												oil well for topical blends. Our wildcrafted lemongrass essential oil is steam distilled from fields

												Lemongrass ct. rhodinol essential oil’s aroma is herbal, with soft notes of lime and rose (calming
												and lovely!) This is a rare lemongrass variety. Most lemongrass is rich in “citral,” which purifies
												against germs and irritates the skin. This special lemongrass oil is rich in “rhodinol” (a unique
												combination of citronellol and geraniol). While it’s still powerful against germs and fungi, it’s
												also skin nourishing. Use lemongrass ct. rhodinol to soothe irritation and protect vulnerable skin
												from germs. Our organically grown lemongrass ct. rhodinol is cultivated in the lush countryside of
												India.
