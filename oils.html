											Zesty, fresh, and inspiring, lemon essential oil’s aroma smells just like the fresh fruit! The dominant

											sparkling, refreshing spirit everywhere it goes—use it to clean your home, as a single drop sends germs
											running the other direction! Trust lemon to support the breath, muscles, and joints, too. Our organically

											Lime essential oil’s refreshing, bright, sparkly aroma infuses the body with energy! Its reassuring
											presence lifts the spirit out of melancholy and can ease emotional and physical pressure. (Try it
											for muscle cramps!) Most lime oil is cold pressed, resulting in a phototoxic oil that causes skin
											reactions in sunlight. Our lime essential oil is steam distilled and is NOT phototoxic. Use our
											steam-distilled lime oil without concern in topical blends. Our distiller crafts this oil from
											organically grown fruits in orchards dotting the sunny southern Italian countryside.

											Makrut lime peel oil has the fresh, sweet aroma of key limes. This energizing citrus brings inspiration,

											is steam distilled from the rinds of citrus fruits in the tropical forests of Thailand. This zesty citrus

											Green mandarin essential oil smells like warm oranges in the sun! Its aroma is fresh, bright, and

											The red mandarin essential oil has a fresh, bright, orangey citrus aroma (sweeter and softer than our

											Blood orange essential oil is bright, citrusy, sparkly, and sweet—just like a freshly peeled orange!

											Our German chamomile from Nepal is a dark green or blue essential oil (depending on the batch), with
