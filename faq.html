					<div class="salt-cabin">
						<h3 class="faq-cabin">Salt Cabin</h3>
						<button class="accordion">What is Halotherapy?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Halotherapy (also know as Salt Therapy) is an inhalation of kinetically activated pure dry salt particles. Dry salt is super absorbent, antibacterial, and antifungal.
								These micro sized salt particles travel deep into the respiratory system and absorb excess moisture, remove allergens, toxins, foreign substances, break up stagnated mucus, restore
								the function of cilia and widen the airways for better lung function and more efficient oxygen distribution. Halotherapy is also topically beneficial and can help manage many skin conditions.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus">What conditions could Halotherapy help <br> provide relief from?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">While the list is extensive, here are some of the many conditions from which Halotherapy
								could help provide relief:</p>

							<button class="accordion">What clothing should I wear?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p class="p-pad">You may wear whatever you are comfortable in. If you would like to expose more skin than
									your
									clothing
									will allow a spa wrap will be provided.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Do I wear my shoes in the salt cabin?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p class="p-pad">You will wear socks in the cabin. You may bring your own or some will be provided for you to use.
									If you are unable to remove your shoes, booties are available to slip over them to keep the Himalayan floor salt sanitary.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">What do I do while I'm in the salt cabin?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p class="p-pad">Take a few deep breaths and relax while you enjoy the glow of the Himalayan salt wall and dig your
									toes into the Himalayan floor salt. You may bring a book or something to journal in if you would like.</p>
							</div>

						<button class="accordion">Can I take my phone or tablet in?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Electronics and salt don't mix so take this time to give your eyes and mind a
								break from the blue light.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What if I'm claustrophobic?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">There is a door and window in the salt cabin that you can see out of. Opening
								the blinds and letting sunlight in the window seems to help those with claustrophobia
								relax and enjoy their time. If you get uncomfortable you may end your
								session at any time.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Should I remove my jewelry?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">This depends, salt can be corrosive to non-precious metals. We recommend
								removing any costume jewelry and watches. Wedding rings and other jewelry made of
								gold, platinum, titanium, etc. will be fine left on.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Will I sweat in the salt cabin?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">No, the salt cabin stays at room temperature.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus">I have allergies, is there anything of concern <br> in the salt
							solution?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">The salt used in the cabin is pharmaceutical grade which means it has been
								tested for purity with no additives. You will only be exposed to pure, dry salt.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus">I've been told to lower my salt intake how will <br> this affect me?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Pharmaceutical grade salt is different than table salt since it is pure with no
								additives. Also, since you will be breathing it in versus digesting it through your
								stomach salt therapy should not affect those markers. Always consult with your
								physician if you have specific concerns.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus">I like to wear perfume, can I get in the salt <br> cabin?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">We kindly ask that you reserve putting on your favorite fragrance until after your
								time in the cabin. The cabin is ventilated and cleaned between each client, however,
								heavy fragrances can linger causing those with allergies to be affected.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Can children benefit from Halotherapy?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Absolutely, Halotherapy is a gentle and natural therapy and is appropriate for
								children 6 months and older. For very young children the salt concentration will be
								adjusted. Kids love their time in the salt cabin playing in the Himalayan floor salt and
								listening to music. They may also bring a book if they would like.</p>
						</div>

					<div class="infrared">
						<h3 class="faq-infrared">Infrared</h3>
						<button class="accordion">What is Infrared Therapy?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Infrared is a safe and gentle wavelength in the natural spectrum of light.
								It penetrates human tissue and the energy it delivers is just the right
								nudge cells need to stimulate warmth, growth, and release. Infrared
								saunas emit lightwaves that penetrate the body to stimulate health
								benefits from within.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus">What is the difference between a traditional <br> sauna and an infrared
							sauna?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Traditional saunas heat the air to a point that initiates the body’s natural cooling process.
								This means that blood comes to the surface of the skin and opens the pores.<br><br>
								Infrared saunas emit safe lightwaves that penetrate the body to stimulate the health benefits from within at
								a cellular level and allow for a deeper detox.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What type of infrared sauna do you have?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Renegade Wellness Center has chosen a far infrared sauna bed. This allows for a private,
								comfortable experience and allows you to keep your face out of the direct heat. Since your face tends to get hot first, keeping
								it out of the sauna bed allows your body to tolerate longer sessions and therefore deeper detox and better health benefits.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus">What all is included and how long is the <br> infrared therapy
							session?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Your session will total 45 minutes which includes 25-40 minutes in the sauna depending on your preference and
								the rest of the time spent as cool down time in a relaxing environment. A bottle of alkaline or regular water will be provided
								so that you can rehydrate. Your session will also include rose water mist and cooling pads for the eyes or forehead applied 15
								minutes into your session if you like.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What are the benefits of infrared therapy?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">There are many clinically proven benefits to infrared therapy:<br><br>

								- Boosts Metabolism<br>
								- Supports Weight Loss<br>
								- Supports Detoxification<br>
								- Improves Heart Health<br>
								- Aids in Muscle Repair & Joint Health<br>
								- Increases Circulation<br>
								- Improves Flexibility<br>
								- Relieves Stress<br>
								- Promotes Relaxation<br>
								- Rejuvenates Skin<br>
								- Improves Sleep Quality<br>
								- Strengthens Immunity</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Do you sweat during infrared therapy?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">You will sweat during infrared therapy. Some people will sweat more than others but sweating is part of the
								natural detox process and is fantastic for the body. You will have time to cool down and rehydrate after your time in the infrared bed.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion plus2">Can the heat level be adjusted if I’m more sensitive?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Yes, the infrared sauna bed has 3 different sections that can be controlled separately to
								create a custom experience for you.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What do I wear during a sauna session?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">The less you wear the better. It is recommended to get in the sauna bed without
								clothing so that	the infrared can penetrate your tissues as deep as possible. You may wear undergarments
								or light gym clothing if you are more comfortable just make sure to bring fresh ones to change into after
								your session since you will be sweating. Spa wraps are also provided for cool down so that you can stop
								sweating before you get dressed.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">What is the age limit for infrared therapy?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">Infrared therapy at Renegade Wellness Center is geared for ages 16 and up.
								However, infrared therapy is used on newborns in hospitals so it is safe for children
								with some restrictions and a shorter session. Please ask if you are interested in
								sessions for children younger than 16 and we can discuss your options and whether it
								is right for your child.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Who shouldn’t use the Infrared Sauna?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p class="p-pad">You should not use the infrared sauna if you are pregnant, have cardiovascular issues including
								a pacemaker or defibrillator, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, have a chronic condition that reduces
								your ability to sweat, are a hemophiliac or are prone to bleeding, or if you have a fever or insensitivity to heat.</p>
